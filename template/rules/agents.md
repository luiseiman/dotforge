# Agent Orchestration Protocol

## Delegation Decision Tree

Before starting any task, evaluate:

1. **Single-file fix / quick question** → handle directly, no subagent
2. **Research-heavy or verbose output** → delegate to `researcher`
3. **Code changes + tests needed** → delegate to `implementer`
4. **Security/vulnerability concern** → delegate to `security-auditor`
5. **Multi-component refactor (>3 files, >2 concerns)** → evaluate Agent Teams
6. **Code review before merge** → delegate to `code-reviewer`
7. **Architecture decision or tradeoff analysis** → delegate to `architect`
8. **Session analysis / pattern detection / /forge insights** → delegate to `session-reviewer`

## Subagent Invocation Rules

- Use `Agent(subagent_type="<name>", ...)` to spawn new subagents
- To continue a subagent's work, use `SendMessage({to: agentId})` — NEVER spawn a new agent for follow-up
- Pass minimal, focused context — don't dump the full conversation
- Each subagent must return a structured summary, not raw output
- Chain subagents sequentially: researcher → architect → implementer → test-runner → code-reviewer
- If a subagent result is unclear or incomplete, resume it via SendMessage — don't restart

## Agent Teams Escalation Criteria

Spawn an Agent Team ONLY when ALL of these hold:
- Task touches ≥3 independent components/files
- Components don't share mutable state during the task
- Estimated single-agent time >15 min
- Each teammate can own a distinct file set (no overlap)

Team pattern: Lead (coordinates, no implementation) + max 3-4 teammates.
Each teammate MUST use `isolation: "worktree"`. Lead merges branches. Plan approval required.

## Task Tracking

Use `TodoWrite` for multi-step work (≥3 actions). Mark steps completed immediately, not in batch. Session-scoped only.

## Context & Error Handling

- Subagent raw output must not exceed 30% of main context — always structured summaries
- After compaction, re-summarize active agent results if still relevant
- If a subagent fails → log to `CLAUDE_ERRORS.md`, don't retry blindly
- Always verify subagent output (run tests/lint) before declaring done
